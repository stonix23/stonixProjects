"Six o'clock on a Christmas morning..."
 "And for what?"
 "Well, isn't it for the honor of God, Aunt Kate?"
 "I know all about the honor of God, Mary Jane."

 Six o'clock the siren kicks him from a dream
 Tries to shake it off but it just won't stop
 Can't find the strength but he's got promises to keep
 And wood to chop before he sleeps

 I may never get over
 but never's better than now
 I've got bases to cover

 He's in the parking lot and he's just sitting in his car
 It's nine o'clock but he can't get out
 He lights a cigarette
 and turns the music down
 but just can't seem to shake that sound

 Once I thought I'd get over
 but it's too late for me now
 I've got bases to cover

 Melody walks through the door
 and memory flies out the window
 and nobody knows what they want
 'til they finally let it all go

 The pain inside
 coming outside

 So many ways to drown a man
 So many ways to drag him down
 Some are fast and some take years and years
 Can't hear what he's saying when he's talking in his sleep
 He finally found the sound but he's in too deep

 I could never get over
 Is it too late for me now?
 Feel like blowing my cover

 Melody walks through the door
 and memory flies out the window
 and nobody knows what they want
 'til they finally let it all go

 But don't cut your losses too soon
 'cause you'll only be cutting your throat
 And answer a call while you still hear at all
 'cause nobody will if you won't

[Samples from the film "The Dead", an adaptation of James Joyce's short story from his book]
 "Six o'clock on a Christmas morning..."
 "I know all about the honor of God, Mary..."
 "I know all about the honor of God, Mary Jane."



2. Caught In A Web

 Silence disguised
 I watch you
 Show me the hurt
 that haunts you
 would you despise the thrill
 If all you hide were mine?

 I can't hold on any longer
 These feelings keep growing stronger
 Echoes that deafen the mind
 will bury my voice in their wake

 Caught in a Web
 Removed from the world
 Hanging on by a thread
 Spinning the lies
 devised in my head
 Caught in a Web refused by the world
 Hanging on by a thread
 Spinning a cage denied and misread

 I've seen the path
 the one you take
 shows the truth
 for you to make
 This turn of phrase
 we might not see
 is the thirst of desire
 found so easily

 Try to push me 'round
 the world some more
 And make me live in fear
 I bare all that I am
 made of now
 Attractive I don't care
 'Cause even when I danced with life
 no one was there to share

 Does this voice the wounds of your soul?
 Does this voice the wounds of your soul?

 Caught in a Web
 Removed from the world
 Hanging on by a thread
 Spinning the lies
 devised in my head

 Tried to live the life
 you live and saw
 It doesn't work for me
 I bare all that I am
 made of now
 Attractive, I can't be
 Inside the Dance of Life is one
 I'll never hold to me

 You can't heal the wounds of my soul.
 You can't heal the wounds of my soul.

 Caught in a Web
 Removed from the world
 Hanging on by a thread
 Spinning the lies
 devised in my head

 Caught in a Web
 Refused by the world
 Hanging on by a thread
 Spinning a cage
 Denied and misread



3. Innocence Faded

 Animation
 breathes a cloudless mind
 Fascination
 leaves the doubting blind
 Until the circle breaks and wisdom lies ahead
 the faithful live Awake
 the rest remain misled

 Some will transcend spinning years
 One as if time disappears

 Innocence faded
 the mirror falls behind you
 Trinity jaded
 I break down walls to find you

 Callow and vain
 fixed like a fossil, shrouding pain
 Passionless stage
 Distant like brothers
 Wearing apathetic displays
 Sharing flesh like envy in cages
 Condescending
 Not intending to end

 Some will transcend spinning years
 One as if time disappears

 Innocence faded
 the mirror falls behind you
 Trinity jaded
 I break down walls to find you

 Beginnings get complicated
 the farther we progress
 Opinions are calculated
 Immune to openness

 Beyond the circle's edge
 We're driven by her blessings
 Forever hesitating
 Caught beneath the wheel

 Innocence faded
 the mirror falls behind you
 Cynically jaded
 The child will crawl to find you.



4. Erotomania

[Instrumental]



5. Voices

 'Love, just don't stare'
 He used to say to me
 every Sunday morning
 The spider in the window
 The angel in the pool
 The old man takes the poison
 Now the widow makes the rules

 'So speak, I'm right here'
 She used to say to me
 not a word, not a word
 Judas on the ceiling
 the Devil in my bed
 I guess Easter's never coming
 So I'll just wait inside my head

 Like a scream but sort of silent
 living off my nightmares

 Voices repeating me
 'Feeling threatened?
 We reflect your hopes and fears.'
 Voices discussing me
 'Others steal your thoughts
 they're not confined
 within your mind.'

 Thought disorder
 Dream control
 Now they read my mind on the radio
 But where was the Garden of Eden?

 I feel elated
 I feel depressed
 Sex is death, Death is sex
 Says it right here on my Crucifix

 Like a scream but sort of silent
 living off my nightmares

 Voices protecting me
 'Good behavior
 brings the Savior
 to his knees.'
 Voices rejecting me
 'Others steal your thoughts
 they're not confined
 to your own mind.'

[Dialogue by rap artist Prix-mo reading from the book "Cultural Revolution".]
 "I don't wanna be here, 'cause of my
 suffering, 'cause of my illness.
 Only love is worth having, only
 love is what matters, loving every 
 people on equal terms. "
 "You've got to know who you're 
 dealin' with because, like a stranger, 
 a-heh, just might come in through
 here with a gun... and then, what 
 would you do? (Heh.)"
 "Everything is immaterial..."
 "'n' you know that reality is immaterial."
 "This is not reality..."

 I'm kneeling on the floor
 staring at the wall
 like the spider in the window
 I wish that I could speak
 Is there fantasy in refuge?
 God in politicians?
 Should I turn on my religion?
 These demons in my head tell me to

 I'm lying here in bed
 Swear my skin is inside out
 Just another Sunday morning

 Seen my diary on the newsstand
 Seems we've lost the truth to quicksand
 It's a shame no one is praying
 'Cause these voices in my head
 keep saying...

 'Love, just don't stare.'
 'Reveal the Word when you're
 supposed to'
 Withdrawn and introverted
 Infectiously perverted
 'Being laughed at and confused
 keeps us pleasantly amused
 enough to stay.'

 Maybe I'm just Cassandra fleeting
 Twentieth century Icon bleeding
 Willing to risk Salvation
 to escape from isolation

 I'm witness to redemption
 heard you speak but never listened
 Can you rid me of my secrets?
 Deliver us from Darkness?

 Voices repeating me
 'Feeling threatened?
 We reflect your hopes and fears.'
 Voices discussing me
 Don't expect your own Messiah
 This neverworld which you desire
 is only in your mind.



6. The Silent Man

 A question well served,
 'Is silence like a fever?'
 'A voice never heard?'
 'Or a message with no receiver?'

 Pray they won't ask
 Behind the stained glass
 There's always one more mask

 Has man been a victim
 of his woman, of his father?
 if he elects not to bother,
 will he suffocate their faith?

 Desperate to fall
 Behind the Great Wall
 That separates us all

 When there is reason
 Tonight I'm Awake
 when there's no answer
 Arrive the Silent Man

 If there is balance
 tonight He's Awake
 If they have to suffer
 There lies the Silent Man

 Sin without deceivers
 A God with no believers
 I could sail by
 on the Winds of Silence
 And maybe they won't notice
 But this time I think
 It'd be better if I swim

 When there is reason
 Tonight I'm Awake
 When there's no answer
 Arrive the Silent Man
 If there is balance
 Tonight he's Awake
 But if they have to suffer
 There lies the Silent Man



7. The Mirror

 Temptation-
 Why won't you leave me alone?
 Lurking Every Corner, everywhere I go

 Self Control-
 Don't turn your back on me now
 When I need you the most

 Constant pressure tests my will
 My will or my won't
 My Self Control escapes from me still...

 Hypocrite-
 How could you be so cruel
 and expect my faith in return?

 Resistance-
 Is not as hard as it seems
 When you close the door

 I spent so long trusting in you
 I trust you forgot
 Just when I thought I believed in you...

[Sample is Meryl Streep from the film "Falling In Love".]
 "What're you doing? 
 What're you doing?"

 It's time for me to deal
 Becoming all too real
 living in fear-
 Why did you lie and pretend?
 This has come to an end
 I'll never trust you again
 It's time you made your amends
 Look in the mirror my friend

[Sample is Jeremy Irons from the film "Damage".]
 "That I haven't behaved as I should"
[Sample is Mary Beth Hurt from the film "Light Sleeper".]
 "Everything you need is around you. The only danger is inside you."
[Sample is Jeremy Irons from the film "Damage".]
 "I thought you could control life, but it's not like that. There are things you can't control."

 Let's stare the problem right in the eye
 It's plagued me from coast to coast
 Racing the clock to please everyone
 All but the one who matters the most

 Reflections of reality
 are slowly coming into view
 How in the hell could you possibly forgive me?
 After all the hell I put you through

 It's time for me to deal
 Becoming all too real
 living in fear-
 Why'd I betray my friend?
 Lying until the end
 Living life so pretend
 It's time to make my amends
 I'll never hurt you again



8. Lie

 Daybreak
 at the bottom of lake
 it's a hundred degrees I can't breathe
 And I won't get out
 'til I figure it out
 Though I'm weak like I can't believe
 So you tell me 'trust me' l can trust you
 Just let me show you
 But I gotta work it out in a shadow of doubt
 'cause I don't know if I know you

 Doing fine but don't waste my time
 Tell me what it is you want to say
 You sin, you win, just let me in - hurry
 I've been out in the rain all day
 So you tell me 'trust me' I can trust you
 as far as I can throw you
 And I'm trying to get out of a shadow of doubt
 'cause I don't know if I know you

 Don't tell me you wanted me
 Don't tell me you thought of me
 I won't, I swear I won't
 (Did)
 I'll try, I swear I'll try
 (Lie)

 Mother Mary quite contrary
 Kiss the boys and make them wary
 Things are getting just a little bit scary
 It's a wonder I can still breathe

 Never been much of a doubting Thomas
 but nothing breaks like a broken promise
 You tell me 'bout your two more coming
 but once is just enough for me

 Don't tell me you wanted me
 Don't tell me you thought of me
 I won't, I swear I won't (did)
 I'll try, I swear I'll try (lie)

 I had gotten used to being a soul destroyed
 She comes in apparently to fill the void
 All dogs need a leash and
 at least I'll forget it
 And she would never hurt me though
 she's never said it
 But I'm not gonna ask her today
 I don't wanna scare her away
 Your town, I'm all alone
 and I just can't stare at the phone
 I wanna talk about lifelong mistakes
 and you can tell your stepfather I said so



9. Lifting Shadows Off A Dream

 He seems alone and silent
 thoughts remain without an answer
 Afraid and uninvited
 he slowly drifts away

 Moved by desire and fear
 Breaking delicate wings

 Lifting shadows
 off a Dream once broken
 She can turn a drop of water
 Into an ocean

 As the rain is pouring down
 Tears of sorrow wash his mind
 Drifting with the current
 This stream of life flows on

 He seems alone and silent
 waiting on his hands and knees
 The chill of winter's darkness sits quietly

 Moved by desire and fear
 he takes a few steps away

 Lifting shadows
 off a Dream once broken
 She can turn a drop of water
 Into an ocean

 And she listens openly

 He pours his soul into the water
 reflecting the mystery
 She carries him away
 and the winds die slowly

 And she listens openly
 And she listens openly

 Lifting shadows
 off a Dream once broken
 She can turn a drop of water
 Into an ocean

 Lifting Shadows off a Dream
 Lifting Shadows off a Dream



10. Scarred

 To Rise, To Fall.
 To Hurt, To Hate.
 To Want, To Wait.
 To Heal, To Save.

 Can't hear it
 we fear it
 awareness won't come near it

 Distractive
 Reactive
 Disguised in spite of time

 I never bared my emotion
 My passion always strong
 I never lost my devotion
 but somewhere fate went wrong

 Can't let them rape me again
 Your venom's not family here
 won't let them fill me with
 fatalistic remedies

 What if the rest of the world
 was hopelessly blinded by fear?
 Where would my sanctity live?
 Suddenly nobody cares.

 It's never enough
 You're wasting your time
 Isn't there something I could say?
 You don't understand
 You're closing me out
 How can we live our lives this way?

 You tell me I'm wrong
 I'm risking my life
 Still, I have nothing in return
 I show you my hands
 You don't see the scars
 Maybe you'll leave me here to burn.

 What if the rest of the world
 was hopelessly drowning in vain?
 Where would our self pity run?
 Suddenly everyone cares.

 Blood...Heal me
 Fear...Change me
 Belief will always save me
 Blood...Swearing
 Fear...Staring
 Conviction made aware

 Give up on misery
 Turn your back on dissent
 Leave their distrust behind
 Wash your hands of regret

 Do you feel you don't know me anymore?
 And do you feel I'm afraid of your love?
 And how come you don't want me asking?
 And how come my heart's not invited?
 You say you want everyone happy
 Well, we're not laughing.

 And how come you don't understand me?
 And how come I don't understand you?
 Thirty years say we're in this together
 So open your eyes.

 People in prayer for me
 everyone there for me
 Sometimes I feel I should face this alone
 My soul exposed
 It calms me to know that I won't

 Blood...Heal me
 Fear...Change me
 Belief will always save me
 Blood...Swearing
 Fear...Staring
 Conviction made aware

 Give up on misery
 Turn your back on dissent
 Leave their distrust behind
 Wash your hands of regret

 Blood...Heal me
 Fear...Change me
 Belief will always save me
 Blood...Swearing
 Fear...Staring
 Conviction made aware

 Learning from misery
 Staring back at dissent
 Leaving distrust behind
 I'm inspired and content



11. Space-Dye Vest

 Falling through pages of Martens on angels
 Feeling my heart pull west
 I saw the future dressed as a stranger
 love in a space-dye vest

 Love is an act of blood and I'm bleeding
 a pool in the shape of a heart
 Beauty projection in the reflection
 Always the worst way to start

[Sample is Julian Sands from the film "A Room With A View".]
 "But he's the sort who can't know
 anyone intimately, least of all a
 woman. He doesn't know what a woman
 is. He wants you for a possession, 
 something to look at like a painting or an ivory box. 
 Something to own and to display. He doesn't want you to be real, 
 or to think or to live. He doesn't love you, but I love you. 
 I want you to have your own thoughts and ideas and 
 feelings, even when
 I hold you in my arms. It's our last chance... It's our 
 last chance..."

 Now that you're gone I'm trying to take it
 Learning to swallow the rage
 Found a new girl I think we can make it
 as long as she stays on the page

 This is not how I want it to end
 And I'll never be open again

[Sample from "The Trouble With Evan", from the Canadian series "The Fifth Estate".]
 "...I was gonna move out...ummm...get,
 get a job, get my own place, ummm, 
 but... I go into the mall where I
 want to work and they tell me, I'm, 
 I was too young..."

[Sample is Jim Hill from a news commentary about the OJ Simpson freeway chase.]
 "Some people, gave advice before,
 about facing the facts, about
 facing reality. And this is, this
 without a doubt, is his biggest 
 challenge ever. He's going to have to face it. 
 You're gonna have to try, he's gonna to have to try and, 
 uh, and, and, and get some help here. I mean no one can 
 say they know how he feels."

[Sample from the Conan O'Brien show.]
 "That, so they say that, in ya know
 like, Houston or something, you'd
 say it's a hundred and eighty degrees, 
 but it's a dry heat.
 In Houston they say that?
 Oh, maybe not. I'm all mixed up.
 Dry until they hit the swimming pool."

[Sample from "The Trouble With Evan", from the Canadian series "The Fifth Estate".]
 "...I get up with the sun... Listen.
 You have your own room to sleep in,
 I don't care what you do. I don't
 care when. That door gets locked, 
 that door gets locked at night by nine o'clock. 
 If you're not in this house by nine o'clock, then you'd 
 better find some 
 place to sleep. Because you're not going to be a bum in 
 this house. 
 Supper is ready..."

 There's no one to take my blame
 if they wanted to
 There's nothing to keep me sane
 and it's all the same to you
 There's nowhere to set my aim
 so I'm everywhere
 Never come near me again
 do you really think I need you

 I'll never be open again, I could never be open again.
 I'll never be open again, I could never be open again.

 And I'll smile and I'll learn to pretend
 And I'll never be open again
 And I'll have no more dreams to defend
 And I'll never be open again
