Pull Me Under [Images: Dream Theater] [Words: Moore] Lost in the sky Clouds roll by and I roll with them Arrows fly Seas increase and then fall again This world is spinning around me This world is spinning without me Every day send future to past Every breath leaves me one less to my last Watch the sparrow falling Gives new meaning to it all If not today nor yet tomorrow then some other day I'll take seven lives for one And then my only father's son As sure as I did ever love him I am not afraid This world is spinning around me The whole world keeps spinning around me All life is future to past Every breath leaves me one less to my last Pull me under Pull me under Pull me under I'm not afraid All that I feel is honor and spite All I can do is set it right Dust fills my eyes Clouds roll by and I roll with them Centuries cry Orders fly and I fall again This world is spinning inside me The whole world is spinning inside of me Every day sends future to past Every step brings me closer to my last Pull me under Pull me under Pull me under I'm not afraid Living my life too much in the sun Only until your will is done Oh this and that too, oh solid flesh, would melt 2. Another Day [Images: Dream Theater] [Words: Petrucci] Live another day Climb a little higher Find another reason to stay Ashes in your hands Mercy in your eyes If you're searching for a silent sky... You won't find it here Look another way You won't find it here So die another day The coldness of this words The message in his silence, Face the candle to the wind... This distance in my voice Isn't leaving you a choice So if you're looking for a time to run away... You won't find it here Look another way You won't find it here So try another day They took pictures of our dreams Ran to hide behind the stairs And said maybe when it's right for you, they'll fall But if they don't come down Resist the need to pull them in And throw them away Better to save the mystery Than surrender to the secret You won't find it here Look another way You won't find it here So try another day 3. Take The Time [Images and Words: Dream Theater] Just let me catch my breath... I've heard the promises I've seen the mistakes I've had my fair share of tough breaks I need a new voice, a new law, a new way Take the time, reevaluate It's time to pick up the pieces, Go back to square one I think it's time for a change There is something that I feel To be something that is real I feel the heat within my mind And craft new changes with my eyes Giving freely wandering promises A place with decisions I'll fashion I won't waste another breath You can feel the waves coming on (It's time to take the time) Let them destroy you or carry you on (It's time to take the time) You're fighting the weight of the world But no one can save you this time Close your eyes You can find all you need in your mind The unbroken spirit Obscured and disquiet Finds clearness this trial demands And at the end of this day sighs an anxious relief For the fortune lies still in his hands If there's pensive fear, a wasted year A man must learn to cope If his obsession's real, Suppression that he feels must turn to hope Life is no more assuring than love (It's time to take the time) There are no answers from voices above (It's time to take the time) You're fighting the weight of the world And no one can save you this time Close your eyes You can find all you need in your mind I close my eyes And feel the water rise around me Drown the bead of time Let my senses fall away I can see much clearer now, I'm blind You can feel the waves coming on (It's time to take the time) Let them destroy you or carry you on (It's time to take the time) You're fighting the weight of the world But no one can save you this time Close your eyes You can find all you need in your mind Find all you need in your mind If you take the time Find all you need in your mind If you take the time 4. Surrounded [Images: Dream Theater] [Words: Moore] Morning comes too early and nighttime falls too late And sometimes all I want to do is wait The shadow I've been hiding in has fled from me today I know it's easier to walk away than look it in the eye But I will raise a shelter to the sky and here beneath this star tonight I'll lie She will slowly yield the light As I awaken from the longest night Dreams are shaking Set sirens waking up tired eyes With the light the memories all rush into his head By a candle stands a mirror Of his heart and soul she dances She was dancing thru the night above his bed And walking to the window he throws the shutters out against the wall And from an ivory tower hears her call Let light surround you It's been a long, long time He's had a while to think it over In the end he only sees the change Light to dark Dark to light Light to dark Dark to light Heaven must be more than this When angels waken with a kiss Sacred hearts won't take the pain But mine will never be the same He stands before the window His shadow slowly fading from the wall And from an ivory tower hears her call Let the light surround you Once lost but I was found When I heard the stained glass shatter all around me I sent the spirits tumbling down the hill But I will hold this one on high above me still She whispers words to clear my mind I once could see but now at last I'm blind I know it's easier to walk away than look it in the eye But I had given all that I could take And now I've only habits left to break Tonight I'll still be lying here Surrounded in all the light 5. Metropolis - Part I - The Miracle And The Sleeper [Images: Dream Theater] [Words: Petrucci] The smile of dawn arrived early May she carried a gift from her home The night shed a tear to tell her of fear and of sorrow and pain she'll never outgrow Death is the first dance, eternal There's no more freedom The both of you will be confined to this mind I was told there's miracle for each day that I try I was told there's a new love that's born for each one that has died I was told there'd be no one to call on when I feel alone and afraid I was told if you dream of the next world You'll find yourself swimming in a lake of fire As a child, I thought I could live without pain without sorrow As a man I've found it's all caught up with me I'm asleep yet I'm so afraid Somewhere like a scene from a memory There's a picture worth a thousand words Eluding stares from faces before me It hides away and will never be heard of again Deceit is the second without end The city's cold blood teaches us to survive Just keep my heart in your eyes and we'll stay alive the third arrives Before the leaves have fallen before we lock the doors there must be the third and last dance This one will last forever Metropolis watches and thoughtfully smiles she's taken you to your home It can only take place when the struggle between our children has ended Now the Miracle and the Sleeper know that the third is love Love is the Dance of Eternity 6. Under A Glass Moon [Images: Dream Theater] [Words: Petrucci] Tell me Remind me Chase the water racing from the sky Always beside me Taste the memories running from my eyes Nervous flashlights scan my dreams Liquid shadows silence their screams I smile at the moon Chasing water from the sky I argue with the clouds Stealing beauty from my eyes Outside the soundness of your mind Bathing your soul in silver tears Beneath a blackened summer sky Praying for time to disappear Beneath a summer sky Under glass moonlight Night awaits the lamb's arrival Liquid shadows crawl Silver teardrops fall The bride subsides to her survival By your hand I've awakened Bear this honor in my name 7. Wait For Sleep [Images and Words: Moore] Standing by the window Eyes upon the moon Hoping that the memory will leave his spirit soon She shuts the doors and lights And lays her body on the bed Where images and words are running deep She has too much pride to pull the sheets above her head So quietly she lays and waits for sleep She stares at the ceiling And tries not to think And pictures the chains She's been trying to link again But the feeling is gone And water can't cover her memory And ashes can't answer her pain God give me the power to take breath from a breeze And call life from a cold metal frame In with the ashes Or up with the smoke from the fire With wings up in heaven Or here, lying in bed Palm of her hand to my head Now and forever curled in my heart And the heart of the world 8. Learning To Live [Images: Dream Theater] [Words: Myung] There was no time for pain No energy for anger The sightlessness of hatred slips away Walking through winter streets alone He stops and take a breath With confidence and self- control I look at the world and see no understanding I'm waiting to find some sense of strength I'm begging you from the bottom of my heart to show me understanding I need to live life Like some people never will So find me kindness Find me beauty Find me truth When temptation brings me to my knees And I lay here drained of strength Show me kindness Show me beauty Show me truth The way your heart sounds makes all the difference It's what decides if you'll endure the pain that we all feel The way your heart beats makes all the difference In learning to live Here before me is my soul I'm learning to live I won't give up Till I've no more to give Listening to the city Whispering its violence I set out watching from above The 90s bring new questions New solutions to be found I fell in love to be let down Once again we dance in the crowd At times a step away From a common fear that's all spread out It won't listen to what you say Once you're touched you stand alone To face the bitter fight Once I reached for love And now I reach for life Another chance to lift my life Free the sensation in my heart To ride the wings of dreams into changing horizons It brings inner peace within my mind, As I'm lifted from where I've spilt my life I hear an innocent voice I hear kindness, beauty and truth The way your heart sounds makes all the difference It's what decides if you'll endure the pain that we all feel The way your heart beats makes all the difference In learning to live Spread before you is your soul So forever hold the dreams within our hearts Through nature's inflexible grace I'm learning to live";
